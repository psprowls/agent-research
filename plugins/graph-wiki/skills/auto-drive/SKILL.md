description: Use when driving a work item's full pipeline unattended via Orca-supervised workers — an epic's entire dependency graph or a lone item's phase sequence — instead of walking one /graph-wiki:next stage at a time by hand. Runs a stateless plan/act/wait coordinator loop over `gw work orchestrate` and the Orca orchestration CLI — binds a Run, dispatches ready stages as supervised workers, handles the design (attend) and finish (relay) human gates, processes worker_done/question/escalation, and resumes cleanly after a crash or restart by re-deriving everything from Orca + the vault.

# Auto-Drive Coordinator

Drive a work item's pipeline end-to-end by dispatching each ready stage as a
supervised Orca worker and looping until the item is terminal. The CLI owns
every decision (`gw work orchestrate` computes readiness, worktree, model,
and the full worker prompt) — this skill only relays: it never picks a
worktree, a model, or a stage on its own.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the auto-drive skill to run the coordinator
loop for `<slug>`."

This session **is** the coordinator — a human-attended session, not itself a
dispatched worker. Wherever this skill says "ask the user," that means the
native `AskUserQuestion` tool, talking to the person running this session.
`orca orchestration ask`/`reply` is a *different* channel: it carries
questions a dispatched *worker* sends up to this coordinator (see §4.3) — it
is never how this skill talks to its own human.

If `gw` is not on PATH, run it as `uv run --package graph-wiki-cli gw …`.

## 0. Preconditions

Check once at the start of the session. Any failure stops with a plain
explanation — no degraded mode, no partial loop:

1. `orca status` — must show a reachable runtime. If unreachable: stop and
   tell the user to run `orca open`, then retry.
2. `orca orchestration run-current --json` — probes that Orca's
   orchestration layer is available on this install. An "unknown command" or
   feature-disabled error means the Experimental orchestration feature isn't
   enabled; stop and say so (do not try to work around it).
3. `gw` resolvable: bare `gw --help` on PATH, else
   `uv run --package graph-wiki-cli gw --help` from the workspace's repo
   root.
4. Workspace resolves: `GRAPH_WIKI_WORKSPACE` is set, or discovery from cwd
   succeeds. `gw work status` fails loudly if not — treat that failure as a
   precondition failure, not a mid-loop error.

Resolve the repo selector once here, too — it's static for the whole
session: `orca repo list --json`, find the entry whose path matches the
resolved repo, and remember its selector for `--repo` in dispatch mechanics
(§3). This is environment lookup, not orchestration state, so caching it for
the session does not violate the "never trust session memory" rule below —
that rule is about *Run/task* state, not static repo identity.

## 1. Run bind

The Run's objective string is the stable join key for this slug:
`auto-drive:<slug>`. Nothing else maps slug → Run — this lookup **is** the
entire resume mechanism. Re-running `/graph-wiki:auto-drive <slug>` always
re-derives the Run this way; there is no separate `--resume` flag.

1. `orca orchestration run-list --json` and scan for an entry whose
   `objective` exactly equals `auto-drive:<slug>`.
2. Found → `orca orchestration run-use --id <run_id>`.
3. Not found → `orca orchestration run-create --objective "auto-drive:<slug>"`
   (this also binds this terminal to the new Run).

Every command in the rest of this skill passes `--run <run_id>` explicitly —
don't rely on implicit terminal binding once other dispatches may exist.
