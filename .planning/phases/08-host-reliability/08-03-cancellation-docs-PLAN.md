<objective>
Write `docs/cancellation.md` at the repo root — the v1.1 reference for what happens when an MCP host sends `notifications/cancelled` to `code-wiki-mcp` mid-fan-out. Document the protocol, the internal unwinding chain, the exact trace record shapes Plan 01 emits, the known orphan-thread limitation, and the v1.2+ future-work paths.

Purpose: closes MCP-09 ("current behavior documented"). Makes the cancellation contract legible to OSS readers, to v1.2+ implementers who will replace the orphan-thread caveat with `aioboto3`, and to Phase 9 (which will consume these trace shapes for renderer/schema versioning).

Output: a single new markdown file `docs/cancellation.md` (~100-200 lines per D-15) with the five sections specified in CONTEXT.md D-15 and structurally mirrored in RESEARCH.md Q10.

Depends on Plan 01 because §3 (Trace Shapes) must document the exact records Plan 01 emits — writing the doc before the records ship risks specification drift.

<!-- Source material for each of the five sections. Executor should not invent content — every claim traces to one of these. -->

§1 — Protocol Behavior. Source: RESEARCH.md Q1 + CONTEXT.md D-03.
- Wire format: `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "notifications/cancelled", "params": {"requestId": "<id>", "reason": "<optional>"}}` (notification — no `id` field).
- Server behavior: stops processing the targeted request, does NOT send a response for that request ID (MCP spec §Cancellation).
- Spec citation: `modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/utilities/cancellation`.
- Race condition handling: a cancel notification MAY arrive after the request has already completed — receivers SHOULD tolerate this silently.

§2 — Internal Cancellation Chain. Source: RESEARCH.md §"System Architecture Diagram" lines 124-183 + CONTEXT.md D-04 + Pattern 1.
- FastMCP (mcp 1.27.x) receives `notifications/cancelled` via `BaseSession`.
- `BaseSession._in_flight[requestId].cancel()` cancels the anyio `CancelScope` wrapping the async tool handler.
- `asyncio.CancelledError` surfaces at the handler's next `await` point (e.g., `await run_query(...)` inside `wiki_query`).
- Propagates into `run_query` → `await pool.run_all(...)`.
- Inside `run_all`, `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` does NOT swallow outer cancel — it propagates (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 3).
- Each `_run_one` task receives `CancelledError`, writes per-item `status: cancelled` trace, re-raises (PATTERNS.md `_run_one` diff).
- `run_all` catches outer `CancelledError`, writes terminal `event: batch_cancelled` summary, re-raises.
- FastMCP's anyio CancelScope exits cleanly; no response is sent to the cancelled request ID.

§3 — Trace Shapes. Source: CONTEXT.md D-06, D-07; Plan 01 implementation.
- Per-item cancelled record (no `event` key — D-07 discriminator):
  ```
  {"role": "librarian", "model_id": "qwen.qwen3-next-80b-a3b", "item_id": "wiki/packages/alpha/alpha.md",
   "status": "cancelled", "latency_ms": 1240, "tokens_in": null, "tokens_out": null,
   "cost_usd": null, "timestamp": "2026-05-17T14:23:01Z"}
  ```
- Batch terminal summary (one per cancelled fan-out):
  ```
  {"role": "librarian", "model_id": "qwen.qwen3-next-80b-a3b", "event": "batch_cancelled",
   "items_total": 5, "items_completed": 0, "items_cancelled": 5,
   "wall_clock_ms": 1243, "timestamp": "2026-05-17T14:23:01Z"}
  ```
- Discriminator: presence of `event` field distinguishes summary from per-item; Phase 9 renderer branches on it.
- Invariant: terminal `event: batch_cancelled` is the LAST record in the trace file when a cancel occurs (VALIDATION.md Invariant 5).

§4 — Known Limitations (v1.1). Source: CONTEXT.md D-05; RESEARCH.md Pattern 3 + Q4.
- `ChatBedrockConverse` does NOT override `_agenerate`; it inherits `BaseChatModel._agenerate`, which calls `run_in_executor(None, self._generate, ...)`.
- `run_in_executor` with `None` dispatches to the default ThreadPoolExecutor.
- When the asyncio task is cancelled, `run_in_executor` raises `CancelledError` in the asyncio task BUT the underlying thread continues executing until boto3 receives the HTTPS response from Bedrock.
- The thread's result is then silently discarded (CPython behavior for `run_in_executor` on cancel).
- boto3 (`botocore.endpoint`) does not expose a socket-close API; interrupting the HTTP call at the wire layer requires async-native boto (`aioboto3`).
- Operational meaning: "clean cancel" in v1.1 = asyncio task unwinds + trace record written. The Bedrock call completes in the background and the result is dropped → wasted call (no data loss, no corruption, just unnecessary cost).
- `wiki_log` and `wiki_init` have no `report_progress` calls and no fan-out → cancel for these tools takes effect immediately at the handler entry point (RESEARCH.md Open Question #3).

§5 — Future Work (v1.2+). Source: CONTEXT.md "Deferred Ideas" + RESEARCH.md Q10.
- `aioboto3` / `aiobotocore`: replace sync `boto3` with async-native client → wire-level cancel becomes possible (drops the HTTPS request at the socket layer).
- SIGINT and stdin-close cancel paths: protocol-correct `notifications/cancelled` is the v1.1 gate; rough-cancel paths land in v1.2 if the orphan-thread cost becomes a real issue.
- Orphan-thread monitoring / cleanup hooks: optionally surface the count of in-flight orphan threads via a debug endpoint or trace metadata.
- Per-tool granular E2E cancel tests: if behavioral nuances emerge in v1.2+, expand beyond the single `wiki_query` cancel test.

Style guide (PATTERNS.md §"docs/cancellation.md"):
- `README.md` style: terse, code-block-heavy, no emojis.
- Section headers use `##` (file title uses `#`).
- Code/JSON examples fenced with language identifiers (```json, ```python).
- No bullet lists for technical prose — use tables where the content is structured.
- Bullet lists are fine for enumerations within a section.
- Target length ~100-200 lines (D-15).

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write docs/cancellation.md</name>
  <files>docs/cancellation.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/cancellation.md` at the repo root. The `docs/` directory does not yet exist — create it.

File title: `# MCP Cancellation in code-wiki-agent` (matches the structure recommended in RESEARCH.md Q10).

Open with a one-paragraph intro (~3-5 sentences) summarizing what the doc covers and the v1.1 scope. State plainly: "v1.1 supports MCP-protocol `notifications/cancelled` mid-fan-out. SIGINT and stdin-close fallback paths are deferred to v1.2+." Use the framing from CONTEXT.md D-02: "spec-conformant MCP host (the same protocol surface DeepAgents CLI uses)" — NOT "DeepAgents CLI."

Then write five `##` sections in this exact order, drawing every claim from the `<interfaces>` block:

**## 1. Protocol Behavior**
Cover: what `notifications/cancelled` is per the MCP spec, the wire format (include the JSON example verbatim), fire-and-forget semantics (server does NOT respond to the cancelled request ID), race-condition handling (cancel may arrive after completion — receivers SHOULD tolerate silently). Cite the MCP spec URL inline.

**## 2. Internal Cancellation Chain**
Cover the full propagation path FastMCP → anyio CancelScope → asyncio.CancelledError → tool handler → run_query → SubagentPool.run_all → asyncio.gather → per-`_run_one` CancelledError → trace records. Use either a numbered list or a code-fenced ASCII diagram (RESEARCH.md §"System Architecture Diagram" is a good model — condense it; do not paste the full 60-line diagram). Explicitly note: "`asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` does NOT swallow an outer cancel — `return_exceptions` only suppresses inner-task exceptions" (Pitfall 3 — common confusion worth surfacing).

**## 3. Trace Shapes**
Show the two record shapes from `<interfaces>` §3 verbatim in fenced ```json blocks. State the discriminator rule (D-07): per-item records have no `event` key; the terminal summary record is identified by `event: batch_cancelled`. Note the ordering invariant: the terminal record is the LAST line in the trace file for a cancelled fan-out. Note the field semantics: `tokens_in`/`tokens_out`/`cost_usd` are `null` on cancelled records (no usage metadata because the Bedrock response was discarded).

**## 4. Known Limitations (v1.1)**
Lead with the headline: "Cancellation in v1.1 is best-effort at the asyncio layer, not at the wire layer." Then explain the mechanism: `ChatBedrockConverse` inherits `BaseChatModel._agenerate`, which calls `loop.run_in_executor(None, self._generate, ...)` → default ThreadPoolExecutor → cancelling the asyncio task does NOT kill the thread. Spell out the consequences: HTTPS request to Bedrock completes in the background; result is discarded by CPython; cost is incurred for the wasted call; no data loss or corruption. Explain WHY: `botocore.endpoint` does not expose a socket-close API. Add the side note that `wiki_log` and `wiki_init` cancel immediately (no fan-out, no orphan thread).

**## 5. Future Work (v1.2+)**
Enumerate the deferred items from `<interfaces>` §5 as a bulleted list with one-line explanations each:
- `aioboto3` / `aiobotocore` — wire-level cancel via socket-close
- SIGINT and stdin-close fallback cancel paths
- Orphan-thread monitoring / cleanup hooks
- Per-tool granular E2E cancel tests

Style discipline (PATTERNS.md §"docs/cancellation.md"):
- No emojis anywhere (CLAUDE.md global rule — emojis only if explicitly requested; doc is OSS-bound).
- Code examples MUST be fenced with language identifiers (```json, ```python, ```text for ASCII diagrams).
- No bullet lists for prose — only for enumerations.
- Target length 100-200 lines (D-15). If the draft exceeds 200 lines, trim §2's prose; the diagram is doing the heavy lifting there.

Final line: add a single italicized footer crediting the source: `*Source: Phase 8 (Host Reliability) — see .planning/phases/08-host-reliability/08-CONTEXT.md and 08-RESEARCH.md for the design record.*`

Do NOT add a table of contents (file is short enough that ## headers ARE the TOC).
Do NOT include any content beyond the five sections (no FAQ, no "Why v1.1?" digression, no changelog).
Do NOT claim the test harness IS the DeepAgents CLI — frame as "spec-conformant MCP host" (CONTEXT.md D-02).

## Trust Boundaries

This plan adds documentation only — no code surfaces, no input handling, no external network or filesystem operations beyond writing a single markdown file in the repo. No trust boundaries are introduced or crossed.

Manual review (per VALIDATION.md §"Manual-Only Verifications" row 1): a reader unfamiliar with Phase 8 internals can, after one pass through the doc, (a) reproduce the wire format of `notifications/cancelled`, (b) explain why cancelling does not interrupt the underlying HTTP call, and (c) identify the discriminator field that separates per-item from batch terminal records.
